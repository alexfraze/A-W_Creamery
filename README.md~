67272 Creamery Project: Phase 5 Starter
---

Style Notes:

Some of the major functions I added to the project were:


1. custom routing on login for the different users. ie. if an employee logs in and has a shift today he will get routed to his shift page. A manager will always be logged in to his shifts view page. etc.... 
2. A nav bar that changes for each user when they log in
3. The ability for a manager to re-add last weeks shifts for the upcoming week. and to add this weeks shifts for next week will make assigning a full week of shifts pretty easy. I have controller actions to do this at the bottom of the new shift page.
