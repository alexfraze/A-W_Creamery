67272 Creamery Project: Phase 5 Starter
---

Style Notes:

Some of the major style additions I made include:

1. custom routing on login for the different users. ie. if an employee logs in and has a shift today he will get routed to his shift page. A manager will always be logged in to his shifts view page. etc.... 
2. A nav bar that changes for each user when they log in
3. The ability for a manager to re-add last weeks shifts for the upcoming week
